A website for the Mount Holyoke College Girls in Tech Conference (MHC GIT). 

The MHC GIT Conference is an annual one-day conference dedicated to inspiring high school girls in New England to explore technology, through engineering, and entrepreneurship. The conference aims to target high school girls at the ripe age of exploration to create awareness among these talented young women about technology and its pervasiveness in almost every field. We seek to debunk stereotypes surrounding tech-related industries that may keep girls from venturing into computer science. The conferenceâ€™s immersion program includes interactive programming and hardware workshops as well as talks by inspirational women who are successfully employing technology in a variety of fields.
